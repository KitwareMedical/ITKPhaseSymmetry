Overview
--------

This is a module for the `Insight Toolkit (ITK) <http://itk.org>`_ that
provides multi-scale steerable filters for computing phase symmetry (PS).

Multi-scale steerable phase-symmetry filters are applied in the image Fourier
transform domain, and have been shown to be a useful pre-processing measure
for performing image registration and segmentation.

Installation
------------

Install the binary Python package with::

  pip install itk-phasesymmetry

To build the C++ module, either enable the CMake option in ITK's
build configuration::

  Module_PhaseSymmetry:BOOL=ON

Or, build the module as a separate project against an ITK build tree::

  git clone https://github.com/KitwareMedical/ITKPhaseSymmetry
  mkdir ITKPhaseSymmetry-bulid
  cd ITKPhaseSymmetry-build
  cmake -DITK_DIR=/path/to/ITK-build ../ITKPhaseSymmetry
  cmake --build .
