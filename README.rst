Overview
--------

This is a module for the `Insight Toolkit (ITK) <http://itk.org>`_ that
provides multi-scale steerable filters for computing phase symmetry (PS).

Multi-scale steerable phase-symmetry filters are applied in the image Fourier
transform domain, and have been shown to be a useful pre-processing measure
for performing image registration and segmentation.
